## Why DBMS?
A Database Management System (DBMS) surpasses file systems due to its robust features.
- Data Integrity
- Access control and encryption.
- Querying and indexing, data retrieval is efficient.
- Concurrent access with locking and transaction mechanisms.
- Minimizes redundancy by normalization, optimizing storage.
- It scales both vertically and horizontally, and performance tuning tools enhance efficiency.
- Built-in backup and recovery System

## Levels of Abstraction

- Physical Abstraction:
    - Describes how data is stored in DB.

- Logical Abstraction:
    - Describes the data store and relationship among data. 

- View Abstraction:
    - Hides details of data types and also for security

## Schema & Instance

**Schema** &rarr; Logical and Physical structure of Database.

**Instance** &rarr; Actual data of the tabel.

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DDL (Data Definition Language) | Defines and manages the structure of the database.                                                             |
| DML (Data Manipulation Language) | Manipulates and interacts with the data in the database.                                                        |
| DQL (Data Query Language) | Retrieves data from the database.                                                                               |

## Keys

| Key Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Key (PK)**   | Uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values. A table can have only one primary key.                                 |
| **Foreign Key (FK)**   | Establishes relationships between tables. It refers to the primary key of another table and helps maintain referential integrity.                                              |
| **Unique Key**         | Similar to a primary key, it ensures that each value in a column is unique. However, it can allow NULL values. A table can have multiple unique keys.                         |
| **Super Key**          | A set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, can uniquely identify a record. It may include more attributes than necessary to uniquely identify records.          |
| **Candidate Key**      | A minimal super key - it is a super key with no unnecessary attributes.                                                                                                              |
| **Alternate Key**      | A candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.                                                                                                                              |
| **Composite Key**      | A key composed of multiple attributes (columns) used together to uniquely identify records.                                                                                        |
| **Surrogate Key**      | A system-generated unique identifier assigned to each record. It has no business meaning and is typically an auto-incremented integer.                                          |
| **Natural Key**        | A key that has a business meaning and is derived from the application data.                                                                                                          |
| **Compound Key**       | Similar to a composite key, but it may include attributes that are not related to the uniqueness of records.                                                                       |
| **Non-Key Attribute**  | An attribute that is not part of any key.                                                                                                                                            |

### Types of Joins

#### 1. Inner Join

An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

## Structured Query Language

### Creating Table
``` sql
create table course(
    course_id varchar(8),
    title varchar(50),
    dept_name varchar(10),
    credits numeric(2,0)
);
```

### Update Tables

Inserting values in tables:
```sql
insert into course values('1012','DBMS','Computer Science',4.0);

update instructor set salary = case
    when salary<=1000000 then salary*1.05
    else salary *1.03
    end
```
Delete:
```sql
delete from course;
```
Drop Table:
```sql
drop table course;
```
Alter:
```sql
alter table r add A D;
alter table r drop A;
```
Basic Query Structure:
```sql
select A1,A2,A3 from r1,r2,r3 where P;
```

### Select Clause
 - Use distinct for selecting only distinct values and not any duplicates
 - Use all to select all tuples.
 - Use * to select all attributes
 - Use can also say Hello World
```sql
select distinct dept_name from instructor;
select all dept_name from instructor;
select * dept_name from instructor;
select "Hello World"; 
select "437" as Foo; 
```

- Arithemetics in select clause:
```sql
select ID,name,salary/12 from instructor;
select ID,name,salary/12 as monthly_salary from instructor;
```

### Where Clause:

```sql
select name from instuctors where dept_name='Comp.Sci.';
-- Logical Opeartors in Where clause:
select name from instuctors where dept_name='Comp.Sci.' and salary > 80000;
select name from instuctors where dept_name='Comp.Sci.' and salary between 80000 and 100000;
```

### From Clause

```sql
-- Cartesian product using 'from':
select * from instructor,teaches;
-- Cartesian Product under conditions:
select * from instructor,teaches where instructor.ID = teaches.ID and instructor.dept_name = 'Art'; 
```

### Rename Operator:

```sql
-- using as to not repeat name of tables repeatedly:
select distinct T.name from instructor as T, instructor as S where T.salary > S.salary;
```

### String Operations:

```sql
-- % char matches any substring
-- _ char matches any char
select name from instructors where name like '%dar%';
-- 'Intro%' matches any string begging with Intro
-- '%Comp%' matches string containing Comp
-- '___' matches string of length 3
-- '___%' matches string of length atleast 3

select distinct name from instructors order by name desc;
select distinct name from instructors order by name asc;
```

```sql
select name from instructors where salary is null;
```

### Aggregate Functions:
```sql
select avg(salary) from instructors where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';
select count(distinct ID) from teaches where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010;
-- Find number of tuples in relation:
select count(*) from course; 
select dept_name,ID,avg(salary) from instructor group by dept_name; 
```

### Nested Subqueries:
```sql
-- Find courses offered in Spring and Fall of 2023:
select distinct course_id from courses where semester = 'Spring' and year=2023 and course_id in (select course_id from course where semester ='Fall' and year=2023);

-- Find courses offered in Spring but not in Fall of 2023:
select distinct course_id from courses where semester = 'Spring' and year=2023 and course_id not in (select course_id from course where semester ='Fall' and year=2023);
```

### Deletion:

```sql
delete from instructor where dept_name in (select dept_name from department where building = 'Watson');
```

### Insertion:

```sql
insert into student from select ID,name,dept_name,0 from instructor;
```

### Joins:
```sql
-- Cross Join:
-- Explicit:
select * from employee from cross join department;
-- Implicit:
select * from employee,department;

--Inner Join:
course inner join  prereq;

--Outer Join:
-- Left Join:
course natural left outer join  prereq;
-- Right Join:
course natural right outer join  prereq;

```
